\section{Comparison with experimental data}
Experimental setups have a few limitations compared to the theoretical treatment, for example you don't have complete freedom of changing the resistance, rather the resistance is changed by changing the temperature of the sample.
This has a few consequences: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since out sample is a semiconductor, the lower the temperature, the higher the resistance, but if the temperature gets too low we enter the ballistic regime, and our treatment is no longer valid.
    \item If the temperature gets too high, the quantization of the hall effect disappears
\end{itemize}
This restricts us to a couple order of magnitude of the resistivity.

Now we compare the results with the experimental data. Let's start from analyzing the data from  \cite{rebecca2022moirè}.\\
In this paper the authors measured the valley hall effect of a heterostructure made of bilayer-graphene on top of boron nitride at different angles $\phi$ between the graphene and the boron nitride. The sample has a width $W=1.7\mu$m, and inter-valley scattering length $l_{\textrm v}=1.6\mu$m and the distance of the contact from the injection point is $x=2.3\mu$m

The angles $\phi$ that were explored are $0,\pi/6$ and $\pi/3$. If you plot the measurements you get figure \ref{fig:rebeccadatapoints}

\end{figure}

Now we analyze them one by one
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $\phi=\pi/3$ we have that the response is fully ohmic, and so we get a completely linear response (figure \ref{fig:rebecca pi/3})
    \item For $\phi=\pi/6$ we have a hall effect, however, since $W\approx l_\textrm{v}$ the ohmic and the topological response mix together, so we never see the full-fledged $\rho^3$ behavior.\footnote{A more detailed explanation was given in the details of subsection \ref{sec:alternaterho}}
\end{itemize}
