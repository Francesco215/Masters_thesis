\section{Gapped Graphene}
If either the sublattice symmetry $\mathcal P$ or the time reversal symmetry $\mathcal T$ are broken the Hamiltonian near the $\vect K$ points becomes a massive Dirac Hamiltonian.
This means that for materials that don't have the parity symmetry $\mathcal P$ such as Boron Nitrite exhibit an open gap in the $\vect K$ points, alternatively one could layer graphene on top of another honeycomb lattice that doesn't have sublattice symmetry, therefore subjecting it with a periodic potential that breaks the symmetry and opens the gap by adding a mass term $\Delta$ in both the Dirac cones.\\
Finding a crystalline structure that breaks time reversal symmetry can be a little more cumbersome, these kind of structures had been theorized by Haldane in 1987 \cite{haldane1988model}, then Kane and Mele \cite{kane2005quantum} proved that this happens in graphene itself if we take into account spin-orbit coupling, 


Mathematically speaking, the tight binding Hamiltonian has two different energies for the two different atoms in the sub-lattice. With respect to equation \ref{eq:dirac_Hamiltonian} it becomes
\begin{equation}
    H_{\vect K_0}(\vect k)=
    -H^*_{\vect K_1}(\vect k)=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta& v_F\hbar(k_x-ik_y)\\
        v_F\hbar(k_x+ik_y)&-\Delta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:gapped-dirac}
\end{equation}
Where $\Delta$ is half the difference of the diagonal energy on the two sublattices, and the energy zero has been shifted at the center of the energy gap. The dispersion relation now becomes
\begin{equation}
    E(\vect k)=\pm\sqrt{\Delta^2 + (v_F\hbar k)^2}
\end{equation}
It is seen that the above dispersion curves are formally the same produced by the Dira equations, with the light velocity $c$ replaced by the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and the rest mass $m_0=\Delta/v_F^2$
