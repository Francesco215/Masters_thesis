    Computing has changed how people communicate. The transmission of news, messages, and ideas is instant. Anyone's voice can be heard. In fact, access to digital communication technologies such as the Internet is so fundamental to daily life that their disruption by government is condemned by the United Nations Human Rights Council <d-cite key="un2017special"></d-cite>. But while the technology to distribute our ideas has grown in leaps and bounds, the interfaces have remained largely the same.

    Parallel to the development of the internet, researchers like Alan Kay and Douglas Engelbart worked to build technology that would empower individuals and enhance cognition. Kay imagined the Dynabook <d-cite key="kay2011personal"></d-cite> in the hands of children across the world. Engelbart, while best remembered for his "mother of all demos," was more interested in the ability of computation to augment human intellect <d-cite key="engelbart1962augmenting"></d-cite>. Neal Stephenson wrote speculative fiction that imagined interactive paper that could display videos and interfaces, and books that could teach and respond to their readers <d-cite key="stephenson1998diamond"></d-cite>.

    While these videos are praised for their approachability and rich exposition, they are not interactive. One radical extension from traditional video content is also incorporating user input into the video while narration plays. A series of these interactive videos on "Visualizing Quaternions" lets a reader listen to narration of a live animation on screen, but at any time the viewer can take control of the video and manipulate the animation and graphics while simultaneously listening to the narration <d-cite key="sanderson2018visualizing"></d-cite>.
